                        <h2>You Should Have a Website</h2>
                        
                        <p>The internet is awful.</p>
                        
                        <p>Instagram, Twitter, Discord, and the myriad of other social media platforms have monopolised social interaction, and stripped the individuality from the internet.</p>
                        
                        <p>Most of my friends know how hard it can be to get in contact with me online. Social media has lead to a world where people can be contacted any time or place, and it makes us feel less close for it. I'll happily sit and talk in person for hours, but can't keep up a basic conversation online.</p>
                        
                        <p>It wasn't always this way, either.</p>
                        
                        <p>I remember often having long, deep conversations over text or phone call. Checking my phone to see a friend had messaged me, and feeling genuine excitement not just at the content of the message, but at the opportunity to speak to a friend. I don't feel that joy from online conversation, and it has killed that joy for texting and calling.</p>
                        
                        <p>Now, when my phone vibrates and lets me know I've been messaged, I don't feel happy. I feel like I'm expected to respond. I'm on my phone, aren't I? Of course I am. Everyone is. Always.</p>
                        
                        <p>But I don't respond. Not as some act of protest against the digital age like it sounds, but from the exhaustion of everyone always being available. And then when I do want to respond, it's been days. Who takes days just to respond to a message? You're telling me you haven't been on your phone in days?</p>
                        
                        <p>I'll stop ranting.</p>
                        
                        <p>What does any of this have to do with having a website? Nothing directly. But having your own website gives you a way of interacting with the internet in your own time. Of sharing things with your friends without having to post them to some site that'll mix it in with ads for the newest iPhone and sell your data to Israel while it's at it.</p>
                        
                        <p>I just want a place online that I can call my own. And I'd like to be able to go to my friend's sites to see what album's they've listened to recently, or pictures of their cats.</p>
                        
                        <p>Ultimately, it's a selfish goal. I don't want to use these big websites, and I wish it didn't mean losing access to what my friends want to share with me. The internet is getting harder to use without selling your soul to AI, and having your own site is a way to avoid it just a little.</p>
