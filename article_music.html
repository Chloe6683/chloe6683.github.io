                        <p>This is a collection of music I'm listening to, or was last time I remembered to update my site. I'd recommend it all :)</p>

                        <h2><a href="https://linktr.ee/be_nice_band"><img src="icons/link.png" alt="Link"> BE N!CE</a></h2>
                        <p>"BE N!CE are a London-based band colliding harsh flavours of punk with post-punk, hardcore, grunge & alternative metal influences."</p>
                        <p>BE N!CE are possibly my favourite band at the minute, and were amazing live.</p>
                        <p>I'd recommend ONE BAD APPLE and GET A JOB the most.</p>
                        
                        <h2><a href="https://mothslutuk.bandcamp.com/"><img src="icons/link.png" alt="Link"> Moth Slut</a></h2>
                        <p>"Notorious for dramatic visuals and intense live shows, the duo rose through the DIY space and made a name for themselves in the wider UK goth scene with a delicious blend of 80's drum machines and modern synth sensibilities.  "</p>
                        <p>Most Slut were the band that got me into Goth music, and have possibly the best stage presence of any band I've seen.</p>
                        <p>I'd recommend Times Like This and Omni Tempore the most.</p>
                        
                        <h2>Stats</h2>
                        <p>I keep a spreadsheet of every gig I've been to, and do a retrospective each year. While I won't post the whole spreadsheet as it gets updates, here are some of the stats:</p>
                        
                        <ul>
                            <li>I have been to 35 total gigs.</li>
                            <li>I have seen 57 different bands live.</li>
                            <li>My most seen band is Blackjack (6 times)</li>
                        </ul>
