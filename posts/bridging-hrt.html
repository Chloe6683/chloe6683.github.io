						<p>In the UK, there are three main ways to obtain a prescription of HRT, each with positives and negatives.</p>
						<ul>
							<li><a href="#gic">Through a Gender Identity Clinic</li></a>
							<li><a href="#priv">Through Private Healthcare</li></a>
							<li><a href="#brid">Through a Bridging Prescription</li></a>
						</ul>
						
						<br>
						
						<h3 id="gic">Gender Identity Clinic</h3>
						<p>Though a prescription through a GIC is the best option, as the doctors involved are specialists and a GIC can also help with other aspects of transition, such as a diagnosis of Gender Dysphoria 
						and any other healthcare you want to pursue, it is by far the most difficult option. With a waiting list of between 29 and 101 months <sup><a href="#ref-1">[1]</a></sup> (2.4 - 8.4 years) to be
						seen and receive a prescription, it is much faster to pursue another method. You can be both on hormones due to a bridging or private prescription and on a GIC waiting list, which is still required
						in order to receive a diagnosis of Gender Dysphoria and/or other medical treatments.</p>
						
						<h3 id="priv">Private Healthcare</h3>
						<p>(All prices listed below are likely to change from time of writing, see sources for those listed by the providers.)</p>
						
						<p>Another option for medical transition is through private healthcare. The largest provider of private transition in the UK is GenderGP. The following are the costs of all compulsory sessions needed 
						before receiving HRT, and the listed costs for various options.<sup><a href="#ref-2">[2]</a></sup></p>
						<ul>
							<li>Information Gathering Session (£65 once)</li>
							<li>Follow up Session (£30 / 6 months)</li>
							<li>Oestrogel (£28 / 3 months)</li>
							<li>Anti-androgens (£10 / 3 months)</li>
							<li>Testogel (£40 / 3 months)</li>
						</ul>
						<p>This leaves the estimated cost of private transition as:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Feminising: £65 once + £212 / year</li>
							<li>Masculinising: £65 once + £220 / year</li>
						</ul>
						
						<p>While this is a far better option for some than waiting through a GIC waiting list, many people can't afford to go private for healthcare, leaving them with the third option:</p>
						
						<h3 id="brid">Bridging Prescription</h3>
						<p>Bridging prescriptions are prescriptions of HRT intended to relieve gender dysphoria while a patient is waiting for more specialised care, such as a GIC, and to prevent them from self-medicating.
						While any GP is allowed to issue a bridging prescription, any GP is also allowed to refuse to so long as they believe they "aren't properly educated on trans patients". A study by TransActual found
						that 80.49% of GPs who were asked to issue a bridging prescription refused.<sup><a href="#ref-3">[3]</a></sup></p>
						
						<p>While this is, quite frankly, <i>fucking atrocious</i>, by finding a GP who is renowned for offering these prescriptions it can be made far more achievable. A searchable spreadsheet of trans-friendly
						GPs can be found here<sup><a href="#ref-4">[4]</a></sup>.</p>
						
						<p>For prescriptions on the NHS, each item costs £9.35. However, depending on how often you receive your prescription (monthly, every 3 months, etc.) it can be cheaper to buy a prescription prepayment certificate.
						This allows you to make a one-time payment and receive all of your prescriptions at no further cost for the specified time. A 12-months PPC currently costs £108.10, which means that regardless of how many items
						you receive you should never pay more than this amount in a year.<sup><a href="#ref-5">[5]</a></sup></p>
						
						<h3>The Anecdotal Stuff</h3>
						<p>Personally, I chose to seek a bridging prescription through Cornbrook Medical Practise, a GP in Manchester that is linked with the GIC Indigo. The practise manager is one of the founders of Indigo,
						 and was listed on the Trans-Friendly GP list<sup><a href="#ref-4">[4]</a></sup> as a highly recommended GP. I had my first call on March 14 2022, and began HRT on May 12th, around 2 months later.</p>
